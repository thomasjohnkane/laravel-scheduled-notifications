### Why use this package?
- Ever wanted to schedule a <b>future</b> notification to go out at a specific time? (was the delayed queue option not enough?) 
- Want a simple on-boarding email drip?
- How about happy birthday emails?

#### Common use cases
- Reminder system (1 week before appt, 1 day before, 1 hour before, etc)
- Follow-up surveys (2 days after purchase)
- On-boarding Email Drips (Welcome email after sign-up, additional tips after 3 days, upsell offer after 7 days)
- Short-Term Recurring reports (send every week for the next 4 weeks)

## Installation

Install via composer
```bash
composer require thomasjohnkane/snooze
```
```bash
php artisan migrate
```
*For Laravel < 5.5:* [Register Service Provider && Facade][1]

### Publish Configuration File

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Thomasjohnkane\Snooze\ServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

## Usage

#### Using the model trait
Snooze provides a trait for your model, similar to the standard `Notifiable` trait. 
It adds a `notifyAt()` method to your model to schedule notifications.

```php
use Thomasjohnkane\Snooze\Traits\SnoozeNotifiable;

class User extends Model {
    use SnoozeNotifiable;

    // ...
}

// Schedule a birthday notification
$user->notifyAt(new BirthdayNotification, Carbon::parse($user->birthday));

// Schedule for a week from now
$user->notifyAt(new NextWeekNotification, Carbon::now()->addDays(7));

// Schedule for new years eve
$user->notifyAt(new NewYearNotification, Carbon::parse('last day of this year'));
```

#### Using the ScheduledNotification::create helper
You can also use the `create` method on the `ScheduledNotification`. 
```php
ScheduledNotification::create(
     Auth::user(), // Target
     new ScheduledNotificationExample($order), // Notification
     Carbon::now()->addHour() // Send At
);
```

This is also useful for scheduling anonymous notifications (routed direct, rather than on a model).
```php
$target = (new AnonymousNotifiable)
    ->route('mail', 'hello@example.com')
    ->route('sms', '56546456566');

ScheduledNotification::create(
     $target, // Target
     new ScheduledNotificationExample($order), // Notification
     Carbon::now()->addDay() // Send At
);
```

#### An important note about scheduling the `snooze:send` command

Creating a scheduled notification will add the notification to the database. It will be sent by running `snooze:send` command at (or after) the stored `sendAt` time. 

The `snooze:send` command is scheduled to run every minute by default. You can change this value (`sendFrequency`) in the published config file. Available options are `everyMinute`, `everyFiveMinutes`, `everyTenMinutes`, `everyFifteenMinutes`, `everyThirtyMinutes`, `hourly`, and `daily`.

The only thing you need to do is make sure `schedule:run` is also running. You can test this by running `php artisan schedule:run` in the console. [To make it run automatically, read here][6].

### Setting the send tolerance

If your scheduler stops working, a backlog of scheduled notifications will build up. To prevent users receiving all of 
the old scheduled notifications at once, the command will only send mail within the configured tolerance. 
By default this is set to 24 hours, so only mail scheduled to be sent within that window will be sent. This can be
configured in the `snooze.php` config file. 

#### Detailed Examples

- [Delayed Notifcation (1 week)][3]
- [Simple On-boarding Email Drip][5]
- [Exposing Custom Data to the Notification/Email][4]

**Cancelling Scheduled Notifications**

```php
$notification->cancel();
```
<small><b>Note:</b> you cannot cancel a notification that has already been sent.</small>

**Rescheduling Scheduled Notifications**

```php
$rescheduleAt = Carbon::now()->addDay(1)

$notification->reschedule($rescheduleAt)
```
<small><b>Note:</b> you cannot reschedule a notification that has already been sent or cancelled.</small>
<small>If you want to duplicate a notification that has already been sent or cancelled, pass a truthy second parameter along with the new send date; `reschedule($date, true)`, or use the `scheduleAgainAt($date)` method shown below.</small>

**Duplicate a Scheduled Notification to be sent again**

```php
$notification->scheduleAgainAt($newDate); // Returns the new (duplicated) $notification
```

**Check a scheduled notification's status**
```php
// Check if a notification is already cancelled

$result = $notification->isCancelled(); // returns a bool

// Check if a notification is already sent

$result = $notification->isSent(); // returns a bool
```
